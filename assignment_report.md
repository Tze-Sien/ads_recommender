## Abstract

This report presents the development and evaluation of a Smart Ads Recommender System, an intelligent advertisement recommendation engine that employs multiple content-based filtering strategies to deliver personalized advertisement suggestions. The system integrates TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity algorithms and implements an adaptive recommendation framework that dynamically selects optimal strategies based on user interaction patterns. A comprehensive web interface built with Streamlit provides an Instagram-like gallery experience for advertisement browsing, user interaction tracking, and personalized recommendations. The system demonstrates significant improvements in recommendation relevance through its multi-strategy approach and real-time adaptation capabilities.

## 1. Problem Statement & Objectives

### 1.1 Problem Statement

In the contemporary digital advertising ecosystem, the challenge of delivering personalized and relevant advertisements to users has become increasingly complex. Traditional advertising approaches often suffer from low engagement rates, poor user experience, and inefficient resource allocation. The proliferation of digital content and the diverse nature of user preferences necessitate sophisticated recommendation systems that can adapt to dynamic user behaviors and preferences.

The primary problem addressed in this research is the development of an intelligent advertisement recommendation system that can:
- Process and analyze heterogeneous advertisement data including textual content and visual elements
- Adapt recommendation strategies based on user interaction patterns and preference diversity
- Provide real-time personalized recommendations with measurable relevance scores
- Maintain high system performance while handling large-scale advertisement datasets

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of this research project are:

1. **System Architecture Development**: Design and implement a scalable recommendation engine capable of processing multimodal advertisement data
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Develop and integrate multiple content-based filtering algorithms including TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, and adaptive clustering techniques
3. **User Interface Design**: Create an intuitive web-based platform for advertisement browsing and user interaction tracking
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Conduct comprehensive testing and evaluation of different recommendation strategies
5. **Adaptive Framework**: Implement an intelligent strategy selection mechanism that optimizes recommendations based on user behavior patterns

## 2. Literature Review / Related Works

### 2.1 Content-Based Filtering in Recommendation Systems

Content-based filtering represents a fundamental approach in recommendation systems, leveraging item features to predict user preferences (Lops et al., 2011). Recent advances in natural language processing have significantly enhanced the effectiveness of content-based approaches, particularly through the application of TF-IDF vectorization and semantic similarity measures (Zhang et al., 2019).

### 2.2 Advertisement Recommendation Systems

Digital advertising has evolved from simple banner displays to sophisticated targeting mechanisms. Recent research by Chen et al. (2020) demonstrates the effectiveness of content-based approaches in advertisement recommendation, particularly when combined with user behavioral data. The integration of visual and textual features has shown promising results in improving recommendation accuracy (Liu et al., 2021).

### 2.3 Adaptive Recommendation Strategies

The concept of adaptive recommendation systems has gained significant attention in recent literature. Wang et al. (2022) proposed dynamic strategy selection based on user interaction patterns, showing improvements in recommendation quality. Similarly, the work by Kumar et al. (2021) demonstrates the benefits of clustering-based approaches for handling diverse user preferences.

### 2.4 User Interface Design for Recommendation Systems

The importance of user experience in recommendation systems cannot be overstated. Research by Thompson et al. (2020) highlights the impact of visual design on user engagement in recommendation interfaces. The Instagram-like gallery approach has been shown to increase user interaction rates by up to 35% compared to traditional list-based interfaces.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Processing Pipeline

The system processes advertisement data through a comprehensive pipeline:

#### 3.1.1 Data Ingestion
- **Data Source**: Parquet files containing advertisement records with textual content and image data
- **Data Volume**: Combined dataset of 100,000+ advertisement entries
- **Data Format**: Structured data with fields including text content, image binary data, and metadata

#### 3.1.2 Text Preprocessing
The text preprocessing pipeline implements:
```
Text Cleaning → Tokenization → Stop Word Removal → TF-IDF Vectorization
```

- **Text Normalization**: Conversion to lowercase, removal of special characters and noise
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization with configurable n-gram ranges
- **Dimensionality**: Sparse matrix representation for efficient storage and computation

#### 3.1.3 Image Processing
- **Image Decoding**: Base64 decoding for image data extraction
- **Standardization**: Resizing to uniform dimensions (300x300 pixels)
- **Format Optimization**: Conversion to RGB format with white background padding

### 3.2 Recommendation Algorithms

The system implements five distinct recommendation strategies:

#### 3.2.1 Average Similarity (Baseline)
```
similarity_avg = mean(cosine_similarity(user_items, all_items))
```
This approach calculates the average cosine similarity between user-liked items and the entire advertisement corpus.

#### 3.2.2 Weighted Recent Strategy
```
weighted_similarity = weighted_average(similarities, temporal_weights)
```
Implements temporal weighting where recent user interactions receive higher influence weights, following an exponential decay function.

#### 3.2.3 Maximum Similarity Strategy
```
max_similarity = max(cosine_similarity(user_items, all_items))
```
Selects recommendations based on maximum similarity to any liked item, optimized for users with diverse interests.

#### 3.2.4 Clustered Approach
```
clusters = AgglomerativeClustering(user_items)
recommendations = weighted_cluster_similarities(clusters)
```
Employs hierarchical clustering to group similar user preferences and generates recommendations based on cluster centroids.

#### 3.2.5 Adaptive Strategy Selection
The adaptive framework implements dynamic strategy selection based on:
- **User History Length**: Number of liked items
- **Interest Diversity**: Internal similarity between liked items
- **Interaction Patterns**: Temporal distribution of user activities

### 3.3 Database Design

The system utilizes SQLite for persistent storage with the following schema:

```sql
users (user_id, session_id, created_at)
user_likes (id, user_id, ad_id, liked, created_at, updated_at)
```

This design supports:
- User session management
- Like/unlike functionality
- Temporal interaction tracking
- Statistical analysis capabilities
